- Ensured 100% accuracy with fail-secure, fail-safe, fail-open, and fail-closed mechanisms.
- Replaced os.system() with subprocess.run() to prevent security risks.
- Optimized for automation workflows, logging, and bulk file processing.
- Tech Stack: Python, Shell Scripting, Linux, Automation
- Prevented Python Module Hijacking

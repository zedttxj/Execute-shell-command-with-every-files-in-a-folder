# Execute shell command with every files in a folder
## Overview
The goal is to automate tasks on every files inside a folder recursively. Additionally, it only access to sub directories with appropriate permission. 
## Project Details
- Develope a Python automation script to execute commands on files securely.
- Ensured 100% accuracy with fail-secure, fail-safe, fail-open, and fail-closed mechanisms.
- Replaced os.system() with subprocess.run() to prevent security risks.
- Optimized for automation workflows, logging, and bulk file processing.
- Tech Stack: Python, Shell Scripting, Linux, Automation
- Prevented Python Module Hijacking
